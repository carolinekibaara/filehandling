# File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment

## Description
This project involves creating a Python program that demonstrates **file handling** and **exception handling**. The program performs the following tasks:

1. **File Read & Write Challenge**: Reads the content of a file, modifies it, and writes a modified version to a new file.
2. **Error Handling Lab**: Prompts the user for a filename and gracefully handles errors if the file doesn‚Äôt exist or cannot be read.

## Objectives üéØ
- Learn how to open, read, write, and close files in Python.
- Handle file-related exceptions like file not found or permission errors.
- Gain experience in building robust programs with error handling to ensure smooth execution.

## Features üìù
- **Read from a file**: The program reads the content of an existing file.
- **Write to a new file**: The program writes the modified content to a new output file.
- **Error Handling**: It handles errors that occur when files cannot be accessed or read, providing clear messages to the user.
- **File Validation**: The program ensures the file exists before performing any operations.

## Installation üîß
